//Building my react app

I used the TMDB API as my source for movies
I set up my react Project
I added movies to state so as to keep everything organized and be able to pass different pieces of state to different components

Created a new folder named components under the src folder, then also created a new file in the components called MovieList.js

passed in a list of movies as props
used Map function to loop over these movies
displayed the movie using the poster URL as the image source

Rendered the MovieList and passed the movies we stored in state as props

Added a call to the API using fetch API
Added  and saved Horizontal scroll, Heading search input, and overlay

Added option to select and save Favourites to local storage
Added option to remove favourites
